# Moisture Minds - Parsec 2023
We have two devices installed in our campus, the user corresponds to each device. "user1_data.csv" contains preprocessed data from one of the devices and "user2_data.csv" from another.

Both devices have some sensors missing, so each file might have different parameters

pm - particulate matter (1,2,3 is categorised into different sizes)

am - atmospheric moisture

sm - soil moisture

st - soil temperature

lum - luminosity

temp - temperature

humd - humidity

pres - pressure
