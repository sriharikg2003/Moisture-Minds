# Moisture Minds - Parsec 2023
We have two devices installed in our campus, the user corresponds to each device. "user1_data.csv" contains preprocessed data from one of the devices and "user2_data.csv" from another.

Both devices have some sensors missing, so each file might have different parameters

ttime - timestamp in yyyy-mm-dd format

pm - particulate matter (1,2,3 is categorised into different sizes)

am - atmospheric moisture

sm - soil moisture

st - soil temperature

lum - luminosity

temp - temperature

humd - humidity

pres - pressure

# Important Instructions
1) Packages Required:-
    pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, lightbgm, keras
2) Open Model.ipynb and run all the cells.
4) We are predicting the soil moisture content for 20 days in March.
